We have use AIML(Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) to make the knowledge base of Chatbot.
We have used ALICE AIML files and also made our own corpus for answering bits queries
For weather forecasting we have used pyOWM(Python Open Weather Map) and nltk for predicting the places in a query
We have used sqlite3 to store the interactions persistently between user and bot

NOTE:Additional novel ideas

1) We have used google speech to text recognition
2)We have also used google text to speech module
3)There is also a provision to google search your queries using google search api
4)We have used multithreading to accept both voice and keyboard input simultaneously.
5)We have used semaphores to make the application deadlock free.
